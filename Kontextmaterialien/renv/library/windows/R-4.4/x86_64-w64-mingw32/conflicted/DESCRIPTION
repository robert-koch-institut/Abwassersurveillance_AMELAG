Title: An Alternative Conflict Resolution Strategy
Version: 1.2.0
Authors@R: c( person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre")), person("RStudio", role = c("cph", "fnd")) )
Description: R's default conflict management system gives the most recently loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts, particularly when they arise because a package update creates ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a different approach, making every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which function to use.
